## READ ME FIRST

This package is licensed under ASL 2.0. See the LICENSE file at the root of the
project for the full text.

This package requires Java 8 or later.

## What this is

This package takes a parse tree as generated by 
[grappa-parsetree](https://github.com/ChrisBrenton/grappa-parsetree) and
generates an SVG file out of this parse tree.

For this, it first generates a [DOT
file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29) out
the parse tree, then calls [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org)'s `dot` command
to generate the SVG.

## Status

In progress.

The basic functionality is working; but it _is_ really basic: node styles, edge
styles etc of the graph are hardcoded at the moment.

You can see an example
[here](https://github.com/fge/grappa-parsetree-visual/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/fge/grappa/parsetree/visual/example/Example.java).

## Versions

None at the moment.

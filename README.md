## READ ME FIRST

This package is licensed under ASL 2.0. See the LICENSE file at the root of the
project for the full text.

This package requires Java 8 or later.

The current version is **1.0.0**.

## What this is

This package takes a parse tree as generated by 
[grappa-parsetree](https://github.com/ChrisBrenton/grappa-parsetree) and
generates an SVG file out of this parse tree.

For this, it first generates a [DOT
file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29) from
the parse tree, then calls [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org)'s `dot` command
to generate the SVG.

## Requirements

Apart from a Java 8 JRE, this program also requires that Graphviz be installed
on the target machine, and that the `dot` command is available on your `PATH`.

## Using it

Using gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile(group: "com.github.fge", name: "grappa-parser-visual",
        version: "1.0.0");
}
```

Using maven:

```
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.fge</groupId>
        <artifactId>grappa-parser-visual</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Example

You can see an example
[here](https://github.com/fge/grappa-parsetree-visual/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/fge/grappa/parsetree/visual/example/Example.java).

This example uses a simple expression parser (which is in the same directory as
the source example), parses the input and generates an SVG file named
`examples.svg` in your temporary directory (typically, `/tmp` on Unix-like
systems).

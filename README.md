## READ ME FIRST

This package is licensed under ASL 2.0. See the LICENSE file at the root of the
project for the full text.

This package requires Java 8 or later.

## Goals

This package aims to take a parse tree, as generated by 
[grappa-parsetree](https://github.com/ChrisBrenton/grappa-parsetree), and
perform the following operations:

* generate an SVG from this parse tree;
* provide a simple visualizer for the generated SVG.

## Versions

None at the moment.

## Help needed

I suck at graphics. On a scale of 0 to 10, pick -1. So, if you have any ideas
about which library should be used to generate the SVG in the first place, I
will happily hear about them...

Right now, the choice is to use Apache's batik-svggen.
